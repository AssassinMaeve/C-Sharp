# 📘 C# Project – MSc Software Technology

## 📌 Overview

This project is developed as part of the **MSc in Software Technology** program. It demonstrates practical implementation of **C# programming concepts** using **Microsoft Visual Studio** and the **.NET framework**.

The project focuses on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code following **software engineering best practices**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: C#
* **Framework**: .NET (Core/Framework depending on project type)
* **IDE**: Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 / 2019
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Community Edition is free).
* During installation, select the **“.NET desktop development” workload**.

### Steps to Run

1. Clone or download this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in **Visual Studio**.
3. Restore NuGet packages (Visual Studio usually does this automatically).
4. Set the startup project (Right-click → *Set as Startup Project*).
5. Press **F5** (Run with Debugging) or **Ctrl + F5** (Run without Debugging).
